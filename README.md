-About Tātai-
Tātai is an application designed to help people learn Maths in Māori. This specific application is designed for elderly people, but can be used for anyone that wants to learn Māori and mathematics. An expression or number will be given and the user will need to recite the answer in Māori. For any other instructions please refer to the instruction manual.

-Starting Tātai-
This program was designed to be used in the HTK-se206-2017 virtual machine, with all files unchanged.
Before executing the program you may need to open the terminal in the same directory as tatai.jar and use command 'chmod 777 tatai.jar'.
To execute the program double click on the provided tatai.jar file or open the terminal in the same directory as tatai.jar and use command 'java -jar tatai.jar'
This program uses javafx, therefore javafx needs to be downloaded, download by using command 'sudo apt install openjfx' in the terminal.

-Extra Data-
The program will create two directories: stats and questions. The stats directory will create a .txt file for all question types. The question directory will create one .txt file to store the custom questions.

-Miscellaneous-
Recordings will last 5 seconds.
Custom questions will allow expressions that include non-integers and answers that are not integers. In this situation, the answer will be the appropriately rounded integer. This is not recommended.
